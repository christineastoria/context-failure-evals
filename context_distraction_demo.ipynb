    "# Context Distraction: When Long Context Histories Overwhelm LLM Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Context distraction is a **real production problem** affecting agents with long conversation histories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As agents perform multi-step tasks, each step generates information that accumulates in the context. With many steps, the context becomes extremely long, and LLMs struggle to maintain accuracy when recalling information from early steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Distraction Definition:** When a simple tool-calling LLM agent accumulates so much context history across many steps that it overwhelms the LLM and causes it to lose track of information, leading to degraded recall accuracy and task completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge: Agents need to perform complex, multi-step tasks, but each step adds to context length. Eventually, the LLM can't effectively recall specific details from earlier steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use a research assistant agent to:\n",
    "1. **Demonstrate** how context length grows with multi-step research tasks\n",
    "2. **Measure** recall accuracy degradation as context length increases\n",
    "3. **Identify** the point where context distraction significantly impacts performance\n",
    "4. **Evaluate** different strategies for managing long contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal: Understand context distraction and develop strategies to maintain accuracy across long task sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Tasks We'll Test\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll evaluate agents on research tasks of varying complexity:\n",
    "- **Small tasks**: 2-3 topics, ~8-12 steps\n",
    "- **Medium tasks**: 4-6 topics, ~16-24 steps  \n",
    "- **Large tasks**: 8-10 topics, ~32-40 steps\n",
    "- **Very large tasks**: 10+ topics with deep analysis, ~50+ steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step generates verbose, detailed information that must be recalled accurately later.\n"
